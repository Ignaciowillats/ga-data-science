# General Assembly Supplementary Teaching Materials
This repo contains some code snippets, datasets and slides related to various courses and events I've taught for General Assembly.

I imagine the slides from my ["Intro to Data Science & Analytics"](https://github.com/john-sandall/ga-data-science/raw/master/slides/General%20Assembly%20-%20Intro%20to%20Data%20Science%20and%20Analytics%20-%20John%20Sandall%20-%20Jan%202016.pdf) will be quite popular.
